"""Target-agnostic stage-1 bit algebra for the CPU scanners.

Everything here is pure `UInt64` arithmetic or comptime data: no
`llvm_intrinsic` calls, no `pack_bits` (which crashes the Metal shader
compiler when lowered for Apple GPUs), no SIMD-width assumptions, and
everything interprets cleanly in the comptime interpreter. The CPU fast
paths in `simd_ops.mojo` / `classifier.mojo` are untouched and their
portable branches delegate here, so there is one formulation of the
algebra.

The target-agnostic shape is deliberate and worth preserving: an
accelerator backend can import the math from this file without device
codegen ever seeing NEON-specific symbols. (GPU support previously lived
in `emberjson/_gpu/`; it was removed when Mojo moved accelerator codegen
into MAX, and is a candidate for a separate extension library.)

Byte -> mask *extraction* (loading 64 bytes and producing per-class
bitmasks) is deliberately NOT here: it is target-specific. The CPU uses
`SimdInput` + NEON tbl/addp or `pack_bits`.
