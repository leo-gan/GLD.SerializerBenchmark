"""Stage-1 indexer: the chunk loop that emits structural character positions.

Ported from simdjson. `structural_index` walks the input 64 bytes
at a time; for each chunk it combines the classifier's operator/whitespace
masks with the string-mask scanners to compute that chunk's structural
bits: structural operators outside strings, every real (non-escaped)
quote, and pseudo-structural scalar starts (the first byte of a number or
`true`/`false`/`null`). Set bits are scattered into the caller's reusable
`positions` buffer by a branchless 8-at-a-time `emit` that trades a small
over-write tail for removing the per-structural mispredicted branch.

Output is deferred by one chunk so cross-chunk carries settle, and the
spurious tail produced by the final chunk's zero bytes is trimmed at the
end. On exit, `len(positions)` equals the true structural count.

Unlike simdjson, the input need not be a padded copy: with
`assume_padded=False` the final partial chunk is copied into a zeroed
64-byte stack buffer, so the caller's original (borrowed) input can be
indexed without any heap copy. `assume_padded=True` requires a
`PaddedBuffer`-backed input and loads every chunk directly.

    Structural characters are `{ } [ ] : ,`, both quotes of every string
    (in-string and escaped quotes are masked out), and the first byte of
    every scalar token. Positions are strictly ascending.

    The buffer is reused across calls: it is only (re)allocated when its
    capacity cannot hold the worst case of one structural per input byte
    (capacity-based, because this function resizes `positions` down to the
    structural count on exit, so a warm buffer has a small length but a

    Parameters:
        assume_padded: The input is backed by a `PaddedBuffer` and whole
            64-byte chunks may always be loaded. Otherwise the final
            partial chunk is staged through a zeroed stack buffer and the

        input_len: Length of the JSON input in bytes.
