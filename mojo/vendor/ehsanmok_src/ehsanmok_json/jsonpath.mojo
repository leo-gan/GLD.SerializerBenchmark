# json - JSONPath (RFC 9535, March 2024)
#
# The previous implementation was a single pass that turned a path into
# a flat token list and applied the tokens one at a time. That shape
# cannot express the grammar RFC 9535 standardised. A bracketed segment
# is a comma-separated list of selectors, so one bracket pair can carry
# several tokens; a filter holds a logical expression tree with its own
# nested queries; and a comparison operand must be a singular query,
# which is a property of a whole sub-query rather than of any one
# token. Trying to keep the flat shape is what produced the family of
# defects that motivated this rewrite: unions dropped on the floor,
# slice bounds confusing "unspecified" with "negative", a negative
# index resolved once and reused across every later array, a filter
# scanner that counted brackets without noticing it was inside a string
# literal, and a catch-all that advanced past any byte it did not
# recognise so that invalid queries parsed as valid ones.
#
# So this is a parser and an evaluator, in that order. The parser
# builds an abstract syntax tree and rejects everything the ABNF in
# RFC 9535 section 2.1 rejects, including the well-typedness rules for
# function extensions in section 2.4.3. The evaluator then walks the
# tree, and every case it can reach is one the parser has already
# proved is meaningful.
#
# The tree is stored as parallel `List`s of nodes addressed by integer
# index rather than as a graph of pointers. A selector may hold a
# filter, a filter holds an expression, an expression holds queries,
# and those queries hold selectors again, so the type is mutually
# recursive; Mojo needs indirection for that, and flat pools are the
# cheapest indirection available. They also make `JSONPath` a plain
# movable value that can be compiled once and evaluated many times.
#
# Evaluation carries a normalized path (section 2.7) alongside every
# value, which is what lets `paths` and `query_with_paths` exist at no
# extra traversal. Note that a normalized path is not a JSON Pointer:
# it is `$['a'][0]` with single quotes, and `json/pointer.mojo` is a
# different syntax for a different specification.
#
# Known deviations, all deliberate:
#
#   - Section 2.3.5.1 spells a singular query's segments without
#     interior whitespace, so `$[?@['a' ] == 1]` is strictly invalid.
#     This accepts it. Rejecting it would mean threading a "saw a
#     space" flag out of the bracket parser purely to reject a query
#     that has an unambiguous meaning.
#   - `match()` and `search()` treat a pattern that is not a valid
#     I-Regexp as producing LogicalFalse rather than as an error, at
#     parse time as well as at run time. RFC 9535 section 2.4.6 defines
#     the result only for valid patterns, and false is the answer that
#     keeps a filter total.
#   - A member name shorthand accepts any byte at or above 0x80 as a
#     name character. The ABNF says `%x80-10FFFF`, which is the same
#     set for well-formed UTF-8 input and a superset for input that is
#     not well-formed.
