# json - Core Value type.
#
# `Value` carries one of two representations, and which one it holds is
# an implementation detail no caller has to think about:
#
#   read  -- a tape-backed view over a `Document`. `_doc` is `Some`, the
#            data lives in `_doc[].tape[_tape_idx]` plus the side pools,
#            and child views share the `ArcPointer` (a refcount bump, not
#            a copy). This is what every parser produces.
#
#   write -- an owned `OwnedValue` tree in `_owned`, with `_doc` empty.
#            This is what the primitive constructors and the `object()` /
#            `array()` factories produce, and what a tape-backed value
#            converts to the first time it is mutated.
#
# Why two: the tape is a build-once layout. A container's children are a
# contiguous run written *before* the parent header, and the child count
# is packed into the parent entry, so you cannot append one element to an
# existing array in place -- see `document.mojo`. Mutating a tape
# therefore means rebuilding it. Doing that per mutation made growing a
# tree quadratic; keeping the owned tree live across mutations makes it
# O(1) amortized per node, and a conversion happens at most once.
#
# A default `OwnedValue` heap-allocates nothing (see `node.mojo`), so a
# scalar or empty container costs no allocation at all -- where the old
# representation built a whole single-entry `Document` behind an
# `ArcPointer` for every `Value(1)`.

    The type behaves the way a caller who has met a JSON value in any

    `in` tests membership, `==` is a structural deep comparison, a

    `items()` / `keys()` / `values()`. `Iterable` conformance is the one
    thing missing: the trait requires an iterator alias parameterized
    over the iterable's origin in a shape this compiler cannot spell for
    a type whose iterator must also carry a mode, so `__iter__` is
    defined directly instead. A `for` loop over a `Value` works either
    way, because the loop resolves `__iter__` rather than the trait.
